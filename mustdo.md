# Project Overview & Checklist

## Project Description

This application is a Nuxt-based solution designed for both clients and admins. The main features include:

- **Admin Panel:** Create and manage dynamic forms for clients.
- **Client Dashboard:** Clients log in to view and complete forms.
- **Unique Link Generation:** Admins can generate and send unique links for form completion.
- **File Uploads:** Clients can upload files (e.g., storing them in S3 or a similar service).

The system should also support conditional logic and field dependencies for forms, making them adaptable based on user responses.

## Components and Features Checklist

### User Roles and Interfaces

- [ ] **Admin Panel (Nuxt Frontend)**
  - [ ] **Form Builder:** Create dynamic forms with various field types (text, radio buttons, checkboxes, file uploads, etc.).
  - [ ] **Conditional Logic:** Implement field dependencies where certain fields appear based on previous answers.
  - [ ] **Form Management:** Manage active/inactive forms and track submission statuses.
  - [ ] **Unique Link Generation:** Generate secure, one-time or expiring unique URLs for clients.
  - [ ] **Client Overview:** Dashboard to view clients' submission statuses and history.
  - [ ] **File Management:** Integration with Amazon S3 (or a similar storage service) for handling file uploads.
  - [ ] **Notifications & Reminders:** Automate email/SMS reminders for pending or incomplete forms.

- [ ] **Client/User Interface (Nuxt Frontend)**
  - [ ] **Authentication:** Secure login system (email/password, with potential for social logins or multi-factor authentication).
  - [ ] **Form Submission:** Guided process for filling out forms, with options to save progress and resume later.
  - [ ] **File Upload:** User-friendly interface for uploading files with client-side validations.
  - [ ] **Submission Confirmation:** Display confirmation screens/emails after successful form submission.

### Backend Considerations

- [ ] **API Design**
  - [ ] Develop RESTful or GraphQL endpoints for CRUD operations related to forms, users, and file uploads.
  - [ ] Secure endpoints using authentication methods like JWT or OAuth and enforce role-based access control.

- [ ] **Database Schema**
  - [ ] Define tables/collections for users (clients and admins), forms, form responses, and file metadata.
  - [ ] Choose a relational (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) database based on data complexity and scalability.

- [ ] **File Storage Integration**
  - [ ] Integrate with Amazon S3 (or an equivalent service) for file storage.
  - [ ] Implement server-side processing to generate secure, time-limited URLs for accessing stored files.

- [ ] **Security Measures**
  - [ ] Ensure encryption of data in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.
  - [ ] Set up regular backups and maintain audit logs for form submissions and file uploads.

- [ ] **Scalability and Performance**
  - [ ] Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
  - [ ] Consider using serverless functions or microservices to handle high load, especially for file uploads and form processing.

### Additional Features and Ideas

- [ ] **Customizable Form Templates:** Allow admins to save frequently used forms as templates for quick deployment.
- [ ] **Analytics and Reporting:** Provide dashboards to monitor form engagement, completion rates, and error reports; include export functionality (CSV/Excel) for further analysis.
- [ ] **Notifications System:** Set up email or SMS notifications for reminders, confirmations, and alerts.
- [ ] **Audit and Versioning:** Maintain a version history of forms to track changes made by admins.
- [ ] **Integrations:** Optionally integrate with external systems (e.g., CRMs, document management systems) if needed.
- [ ] **Accessibility and Mobile Optimization:** Ensure the interfaces are responsive and accessible to all users.

### Follow-Up Questions for Further Clarification

- [ ] **Form Complexity:**  
  - Do you envision forms being highly dynamic with extensive conditional logic and field dependencies?

- [ ] **User Authentication & Authorization:**  
  - What type of authentication mechanisms do you prefer (simple email/password, social logins, multi-factor authentication)?

- [ ] **File Upload Details:**  
  - Are there any specific file types or size restrictions to consider?  
  - Would you like to include server-side validations or virus scans on uploaded files?

- [ ] **Notifications and Communication:**  
  - Should the system support automated reminders (email/SMS) for pending or incomplete form submissions?

- [ ] **Integration Requirements:**  
  - Does the application need to integrate with external systems (e.g., CRMs, analytics platforms, payment gateways)?

- [ ] **User Experience Enhancements:**  
  - Would you like features such as saving form progress, multi-step forms, or offline capabilities?

- [ ] **Administration & Data Reporting:**  
  - What level of reporting and analytics do you expect?  
  - Are there any specific export functionalities needed?

- [ ] **Scalability Considerations:**  
  - What is the expected user load?  
  - Do you foresee needing a highly scalable solution, perhaps with a serverless architecture?
